# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a month-long programming challenge. Similar to an advent calendar, every day a new problem is released. These are my solutions.

### Running

This code is written in ES6 javascript. For best results, run using Node 7.

NPM scripts are used to run specific problem numbers. Each question has 2 parts. You can choose the part you wish to solve by passing it as an additional argument:

```
$ npm run problemN PART
```

For example, `npm run problem1 1` will solve the first part of the first problem.
